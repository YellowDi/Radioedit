    New features and changes
    
    !!! The setting to hide role specific traits for other than your current specs role in the Weight Editor wasn't clear to some people so I changed the default value of that setting for ALL characters (existing and new).
    - Addon now shows all role specific traits in the Weight Editor by default, if you don't want to see them, you can enable it in the settings.
    - The reason why it was on by default in previous versions was because some hybrid classes has access to quite a lot of traits and I wanted to keep the Weight Editor as clutter free as possible, but this caused some people to not find the trait they were looking for and clearly didn't know about the setting.
    - Role specific traits have now icons in front of the trait name to illustrate what roles the traits are aimed for.
    !!! If you can see them in the editor, the traits can still appear and you can pick them even if they are marked for different role. It is not a bug for hybrid class to see role traits for other roles than the current specs role.
    
    
    - Add itemlevel to score calculations can now be scaled using the weight of Azerite Empowered trait (the center trait) if you don't like the default +1 itemlevel == +1 score.
    - All scores can now be shown as relative to currently equipped items scores in tooltips.
    - Relatives scores can be shown/hidden in the tooltips based on if it has any upgrade potential.
    
    
    - Few new lines to translate and at least one changed line for translators. Also made a small help page to this addons project page at Curseforge to give translators some context where some of the strings are used at.
