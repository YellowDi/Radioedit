ElvUI_BenikUI
=============
an external ElvUI edit

- Requires ElvUI 10+. Please run the installer when prompted.

- Suggestions, recommendations, things to add/remove ;) or to say thanks: https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=33

- Enhancements:

>Decors all ElvUI and Blizzard frames.

>3 color themes plus the default ElvUI. 'Diablo' (dark red), 'Mists' (dark green), 'Hearthstone' (dark blue).

>Adds a bar in player and target like TukUI does, that can be used to place hp/power text etc. Mouse over can show rep or xp.

>System Dashboard that shows ms, fps, memory, durability, volume. Volume can be adjusted by left/right click - mouseover the speaker icon.

>Tokens Dashboard based on AsphyxiaUI.

>Professions Dashboard.

>Detached portraits - player and target.

>Buttons beside the chat datatexts, that can show/hide the previous dashboards (left chat) and Game menu - ElvUI options (right side). Shift and mouse over the cornered buttons, will show an arrow to hide the chat (like ElvUI does).

>2 Small mouseovered buttons on the actionbar decor (bar 1 or 2), that can show/hide bar 3 and 5

>Decors to fit with BenikUI: S&L, LocationPlus, LocationLite, Recount, Skada, TinyDPS, Altoholic, AtlasLoot, ZygorGuides, RareCoordinator. Many more to come. Just poke me :)

>All options are in light blue color inside ElvUI options; currently in actionbars, unitframes, player and target portraits.
