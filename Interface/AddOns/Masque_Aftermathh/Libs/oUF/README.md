## Introduction
**oUF** is a unit frame framework.  
It attempts to simplify the process of writing unit frames for WoW by doing all the trivial and painfully boring parts for you.  
So you can focus more on experimenting with the look of the frames.

By itself oUF doesn't do much, a layout is required.

## Documentation
See our oUF 7.0 upgrade guide [here](http://www.wowinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=55422).

## Feedback
Generally, bugs should be reported through the author of the layout.

There's few ways to report oUF issues.  
You may use our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/oUF-wow/oUF/issues), alternatively, you may make a post on the [WoWInterface oUF forum](https://www.wowinterface.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=87).  
The preferred method is GitHub.
