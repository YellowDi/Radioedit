    Update version

commit d465eed53a26c10c89804d9d213bbe6159f37798
Author: Dave Hendler <sollaires@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 1 14:15:37 2017 -0700

    Fix issue with items in BANK_CONTAINER
    
    The default BANK_CONTAINER behaves differently than the default
    backpack, bags-on-character, and bags-in-bank.
    
    This change properly finds items in the default bank (not bags-in-bank)
    and adjusts the results from EquipmentManager_UnpackLocation to work
    properly with GetContainerItemInfo
