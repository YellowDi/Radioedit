    Add "In Group" / "Not In Group" checking to the Combat Log Event trigger
    
    Easy to add. Other potentially useful flags to check would be:
    - Hostility.
    - Object Type: Guardian, Pet, NPc, Player
    - Control: NPC vs Player
    
    Adding any of those would probably best done with a dedicated
    combobox per flag type.

    Implement %c support for "Actions/Chat" and "Conditions/Chat"
    
    Also add a "Run Custom Code" to Conditions, since essentially %c allows
    that.
    
    Also wrap SendChatMessage into a pcall, since it throws a error if certain
    escape sequences are passed into it.

    Fix GCD trigger to show the name/icon of the spell that triggered the gcd
    
    There are two parts to this fix:
    - Trigger the gcd trigger on UNITSPELL_CAST_SENT
    - Check that we have a spell name/icon in the gcd trigger
    
    The second part is necessary as the gcd triggers a good 20ms before
    UNIT_SPELLCAST_SENT.
    
    This also means that the gcd trigger won't show anything if somehow
    the gcd starts without a UNIT_SPELLCAST_SENT. I can't think of a
    situation in which that could happen.

    Model: Move setCameraCall to earlier
    
    I still have no clue what I'm doing with the model's camara.
    
    A fix for ticket 964 introduced a call to SetCamera, this apparently broke
    the example in ticket 968.
    
    This now works for both the Arthas example in ticket 964 and the glaive
    example in ticket 968.

    Tweak handling of chat and sound actions for Conditions
    
    Instead of treating them as properties that are set and unset,
    treat them as explicitly as actions. The actions are only called
    on activating the conditions.

    Fix TextEditor for group editing if paths differ
    
    The TextEditor gets a "path" to the setting it is modifying, e.g.
    data.additional_triggers.3.trigger. For group auras, the function
    appendToTriggerPath tried to figure out the common path.
    
    This fails in the linked bug report, because the custom function
    is in trigger 2 in one aura and in trigger 3 in a different aura.
    
    Instead, build a "multipath" structure in appendToTriggerPath, that
    is a data structure which notes for each id what the path is, and
    teach the TextEditor how to handle that.

    Make custom animation functions similar to all other functions
    
    For some reason animation functions were saved with a "return "
    prepended. For other functions we add that "return " directly before
    loadstring. This meant that in various places the string needed
    to be cut by 8 characters and "return " appended in others.
    
    Somehow that code didn't work though. Instead of figuring out where
    it doesn't, just remove the special casing of animation functions.
    
    Store just the function in the variable and add "return " only
    before loadstring.
