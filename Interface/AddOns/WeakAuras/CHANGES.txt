    Fix Condition toggling inverse for Progress Bar breaking the display
    
    Apparently setting the bar to a zero width resets!! the width. The code
    contains a work around for that ensuring that progress is at least
    0.00001. Apply the same to when we inverse progress in SetInverse.
    
    Also rename region.inverse to region.inverseDirection, as SetDurationInfo
    does already use region.inverse

    As that's probably faster
