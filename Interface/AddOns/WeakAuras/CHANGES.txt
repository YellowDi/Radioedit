    Model Aura: Work around Blizzard bug with cameras
    
    SetTransform is supposed to overwrite the camera that is set on
    the model. But instead it apparently uses a random camera.
    TheDanW promised a fix in 7.3, which unfortunately will change
    the behaviour of models.
    
    Thus, warn against using SetTransform in the option text, and
    change the default for models to not use the SetTransform option.
    
    Also reset the model transformation and others 2s after login, as
    apparently the camera is different while still loading.
    
    This fixes the aura attached to Ticket 968, and also works with
    the aura in ticket 964.

    Conditions: Fix actions not triggering twice for some conditions
    
    For example, a condition for "Trigger 1 active" with only one trigger
    only triggered once, because actions are only done when the check
    changes from inactive to active.
    
    So far, on hiding we stopped checking conditions and thus that check
    was always true, and thus could only once transition from inactive
    to active.
    
    This patch adds runs another condition check on hiding, which will
    deactivate all conditons and their properties.

    Fix potential Stack overflow (#217)
    
    As it happens, there actually is a use for calling WeakAuras.ScanEvents inside of the init script of an aura: doing so triggers ActivateAuraEnvironment, which then runs the appropriate init script if it hasn't completed yet; handy if you want to ensure that one aura (a library of sorts) which defines several functions you use elsewhere is loaded first.
    
    However, the code has no notion of whether or not an init script has begun execution or not, which leads to the possibility of a ScanEvents chain leading back to your original init script. This leads to infinite recursion, and very quickly a stack overflow.
