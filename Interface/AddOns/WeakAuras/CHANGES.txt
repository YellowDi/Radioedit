    Tweak Text Replacements again
    
    Make the code try one character replacements after failing to
    find a variable in state. This is what the old code essentially did.

    Fix Power trigger after Destro fix
    
    UnitPowerDisplayMod is rather strange and returns 10 for lots of
    powertypes. Thus, introuduce two helper methhods:
    
    WA.UnitPowerDisplayMod which returns 10 for just Soul Shards.
    And WA.UseUnitPowerThirdArg which returns true for just Sould Shards.

    Change how text replacements work
    
    Instead of trying all dynamic texts and all members of state,
    iterate the string once. And on finding a %, use all alphabetical
    characters after it. If that string is only one character look it
    up via dynamic texts. Otherwise look it up via the state.
    
    Since we are only iterating once, instead of many times this should
    also be faster than before.
    
    Note: This is not 100% backwards compatible, e.g. %pRage would
    previously replace the %p, this now requires a space.

    Fix invalid usage of "_operator" value in trigger
    
    If a user switches a trigger from a trigger type that has arg with
    a number/longstring tpye thus using a _operator to a trigger
    type that has a arg with the same name but of a different type
    that is not using the "_operator" the setting for the operator
    is still in the trigger data.
    
    Fix this by only using the stored _operator setting if the type is
    actually a number or a longstring.
